# CPM3_2063_Retro
The CP/M 3 operating system, ported to John Winans' Z80 Retro board

Check out John's project at https://github.com/Z80-Retro

The sources contained in this repository are meant to be compiled on CP/M 3.
The files that originated from Digital Research are written in 8080 assembly, 
and are to be compiled with RMAC.

RMAC is part of the CP/M 3 distribution package, available from http://www.cpm.z80.de/

The sources written by me, and the parts taken from John's code are written 
in Z80 assembly and compile with ZMAC. I will include the ZMAC.COM binary 
here, because i could not find a source online.

For building the sources, i reccomend the Altair Z80 Simulator from 
http://www.s100computers.com/Software%20Folder/Altair%20Simmulator/Altair%20Software.htm

I have included .SUB files for building CPM3.SYS and the bootloader LDR.BIN
